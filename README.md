-  I’m interested in gaming, soldering, working on cars, woodworking,  and finally excel spreadsheets.
-  I’m currently learning how to chocolatey and edit .lua  files for WoW.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on not really anything. Hmu if you have an interesting project, preferably hands-on.
-  Currently, I'm not available to be reached out to. I'll change this if that status... Changes.
